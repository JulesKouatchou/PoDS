We provide Python scripts that can be used to run a set of commands 
in parallel using PoDS. The scripts automatically generate the 
necessary files needed by PoDS.

Consult each directory to have more information on each script.

Remark:
   Each provided script can only be run within a SLURM script or an
   interactive session.
