This utility allows users to automatically:

     (1) Tar a set of sub-directories (using the tar command)
     (2) Compress the resulting files (using the gzip command)
     (3) Move the compressed files to the archived location 

Items (1) and (2) are combined in one shell script. Each script is
done for a given sub-directory. The resulting scripts are a set of
serial and independent tasks that are executed in parallel with PoDS.

The user, first needs to provide the directory containing the 
sub-directories to be archived. The utility will only handles
sub-directories but not individual files. The reason is that the
NCCS mass storage system is more efficient with large files (at most
100 Gb) instead of small files. 

After the utility creates large compressed files, it then generates
a SLURM script that is used to transfer compressed files to the 
archiving system. Here the user must provide the archiving directory
and his/her sponsonr code account.

Here is how the utility is used within a SLURM script:

     # Automatically create an execution file 
     # (called executionFile) for PoDS
     # You need to provide the directory name.
 
     /usr/local/other/pods/tools/parArchive/execFile_TarGzip.py directoryName
 
     # Submit the tar and file compression tasks in parallel using PoDS
 
     /usr/local/other/PoDS/PoDS/pods.py executionFile

     # Create a SLURM script (named archiveSLURM.job) to transfer the files to archive.
     # User needs to provide the archive directory and his/her sponsor code account.

     /usr/local/other/pods/tools/parArchive/createArchiveScript.py archiveDirName sponsorID

     # Submit the SLURM script for archiving
     sbatch archiveSLURM.job
