This utility allows users to automatically execute a set of gunzip
commands in parallel. The user only needs to provide the full path
of the directory where the .gz files are located and script, combined
with PoDS will do the rest.

Here is how the utility is used within a SLURM script (or interactive
session):

     # Automatically create an execution file 
     # (called executionFile) for PoDS
 
     /usr/local/other/PoDS/PoDS/tools/parGunzip/createExecFile.py directoryName
 
     # Submit the gunzip command in parallel using PoDS
 
     /usr/local/other/PoDS/PoDS/pods.py executionFile
